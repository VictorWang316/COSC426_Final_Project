This outlines what we have been doing for the last few weeks after the final is posted:

We do what we are instructed to do in lab7, and setup a baseline dataset with minimalist amount of existing data. 

We are able to create training data, testing data, and validating data separately. 

We are able to create the model trained on the data and the prediction evaluated on the testing data.
